# inTouch

## Purpose

inTouch is a lightweight, privacy-conscious social connection app designed to help people meaningfully reconnect when geography brings them close. The app enables passive updates about where friends are based, notifies users when they visit a city where friends live, and facilitates low-friction outreach with location-based suggestions and AI-generated message drafts.

## Goal

Build a modular, scalable mobile app that:
- Allows users to create a profile with location, company, and favorite spots
- Notifies users when they enter a city where a friend is based
- Suggests context-aware places to go and messages to send
- Helps people stay in touch with minimal ongoing effort

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM
- dotenv for environment config

### Frontend (Planned)
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript
- React Navigation
- React Native Paper (UI)
- OpenAI API (for lightweight AI features)

### Development Tools
- nodemon (backend live reload)
- Cursor (AI development assist)
- Windsurf (feature expansion assist)
- Git (version control)

## Development Principles

- Build in modular, testable slices
- Keep backend and frontend logic cleanly separated
- Prioritize simple, intentional UX
- Ruthlessly test each feature before expanding
